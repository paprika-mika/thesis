        In this series I attempt to explore camp aesthetics through children's television. Camp aesthetics, the highly stylised, exaggerated, “unnatural” or “so bad that it’s good”, is often considered bad taste or meaningless, but it is this that attracts us to it. As the camp sensibility is also connected to elegance, androgyny and the history of queer style, I believe it is this certain queerness that can be a powerful tool for understanding complex philosophies. To understand where Camp comes from it is important to understand the performativity of gender roles and the stereotypes that enforce binary thinking. The camp sensibility might not always be queer, but to use the aesthetics of camp means that there is an understanding of the world in style, an understanding outside of the binary box.<br />
Perhaps for a split second you might even forget the existence of any kind of box in the first place. It is not a matter of style, it is the matter of style. I aim to make the “vision of the world in style” understandable by looking at children’s television that introduces a non-binary thinking to children. I am aware of the limitations that come with writing from my own perspective, considering my education in graphic design rather than gender studies or film history. Nonetheless I believe it to be of interest to all cultural fields to welcome an attitude in favor of camp.
